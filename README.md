# dylan-sheary-music-portfolio
An up to date portfolio of all the music I've made from 2020 to today.
This website began as a project in year 13 Digital Tehcnologies, about a year after I had begun composing my own music. 
However, it was going to be deleted with my school account at the end of 2021. As such, here's a new repository for the website, with two new songs built in.
Additionally, I'll be expanding on the site as I create new songs in the future, unlike with the origional assignment website, which only had four songs.
